# Dec27−Dec26 on ICE 3M SONIA: four regimes since the Iran shock

*Follow-up to [UK SONIA Dec27−Dec26: Front-Loaded Hike Pricing and the Calendar Steepener](uk-sonia-front-loaded-hike-pricing.md). ICE 3M SONIA futures **J8Z26 / J8Z27** (Barchart EOD) through 29 Jun 2026.*

The Dec27−Dec26 calendar spread did not move in one direction after the Iran shock. It ran through **four separable regimes** — each with a distinct **overall** curve type (net leg moves), and a different split between **hawk**, **dov**, and **neutral** days. This note pins phase boundaries to extrema in the data, defines hawk/dov with an explicit threshold, and maps where a long Dec27 / short Dec26 steepener won or lost.

## Data & definitions

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Contracts** | J8Z26 (Dec-26), J8Z27 (Dec-27) — ICE **3M compounded SONIA** |
| **Spread** | \(S_t = r_{\text{Dec27}} - r_{\text{Dec26}}\) (bp) |
| **Sample** | 2 Mar 2026 (first post-weekend session) → 29 Jun 2026 |
| **Overall phase type** | `classify_curve_move(ΣΔDec26, ΣΔDec27, ΣΔspread)` on start→end totals (ε = 0.5 bp) |
| **Daily curve regime** | Same taxonomy on each session's ΔDec26, ΔDec27, Δspread (ε = 0.25 bp on spread) |

### Hawk / dov / neutral days

Let **μ** and **σ** be the mean and sample standard deviation of **daily** \(\Delta r_{\text{Dec26}}\) (bp) — i.e. session-on-session changes in the Dec-26 implied rate, not levels or spread — computed over the full sample from 2 Mar:

| Stat | Value |
|---|---:|
| **μ** | **+0.96 bp** |
| **σ** | **10.31 bp** |
| **k** | **1.5** |

| Label | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Hawk day** | \(\Delta r_{\text{Dec26}} > \mu + k\sigma\) → **> +16.4 bp** |
| **Dov day** | \(\Delta r_{\text{Dec26}} < \mu - k\sigma\) → **< −14.5 bp** |
| **Neutral day** | \(\mu - k\sigma \le \Delta r_{\text{Dec26}} \le \mu + k\sigma\) |

So a hawk day is a Dec-26 move in the **upper tail** of the post-shock distribution — more than 1.5 standard deviations above the sample mean. With σ ≈ 10 bp, most sessions are neutral; extreme tails cluster in Phase I.

## Four phases (data-pinned boundaries)

Boundaries follow the structure you outlined; dates are the **nearest EOD sessions** to the cited turning points.

| Phase | Window | Anchor | Spread (bp) | **Overall type** | Steepener P&L |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| **I** Bear flat / inversion | **2 Mar – 20 Mar** | Spread trough **−30 bp** on **20 Mar** (last low before 24 Mar) | +9.5 → **−30.0** (−39.5) | **Bear flattening** | **−43.0** |
| **II** Bull steepening | **23 Mar – 17 Apr** | **Local implied-rate low** both legs (**17 Apr**) | −24.5 → −15.0 (+9.5) | **Bull steepening** | +15.0 |
| **III** Bear steepening | **20 Apr – 15 May** | **Local implied-rate high** (Dec-26 **12 May**, Dec-27 **15 May**) | −13.5 → **0.0** (+13.5) | **Bear steepening** | +15.0 |
| **IV** Bull flattening | **18 May – 29 Jun** | First session after peak cluster; dovish unwind | +3.0 → −4.0 (−7.0) | **Bull flattening** | −4.0 |

*Note on Phase III end:* joint rate highs sit **12–15 May**, not 26 May — by 26 May both legs had already fallen ~25 bp from peak. Phase IV starts **18 May** (next session after the 15 May high).

## Phase I — Bear flattening / inversion (2 Mar – 20 Mar)

**Net:** Dec-26 **+128 bp**, Dec-27 **+88.5 bp** → spread **−39.5 bp**. Both legs sell off violently; front runs → **bear flattening** into deep inversion.

| | n | Share of phase |
|---|---:|---|
| Hawk days | 3 | 20% |
| Neutral | 11 | **73%** |
| Dov | 1 | 7% |

**On hawk days (n=3):** Bear flattening **100%**.

**On dov days (n=1):** Bull steepening **100%** (sample too small for stable shares).

**On neutral days (n=11):** Bear flattening **46%**, Bear steepening 18%, Bull flattening 18%.

**Steepener:** **−43 bp** — the crisis expression loses outright. Paying the front / flattening would have been the crisis trade.

---

## Phase II — Bull steepening (23 Mar – 17 Apr)

**Net:** Both legs **rally** (Dec-26 −45.5 bp, Dec-27 −36 bp); spread **widens** from −24.5 to −15 bp → **bull steepening** (less inverted).

| | n | Share |
|---|---:|---|
| Hawk | 0 | 0% |
| Neutral | 16 | **89%** |
| Dov | 2 | 11% |

**On dov days (n=2):** Bull steepening **100%** — when Dec-26 has a large *down* move, the belly catches bid.

**On neutral days (n=16):** Bull steepening **31%**, Bear flattening 25%.

**On hawk days:** none in this phase.

**Steepener:** **+15 bp** — recovery from inversion as both rates fall, back faster.

---

## Phase III — Bear steepening (20 Apr – 15 May)

**Net:** Dec-26 **+39.5 bp**, Dec-27 **+53 bp** → spread **+13.5 bp** to **flat** → **bear steepening**.

| | n | Share |
|---|---:|---|
| Hawk | 0 | 0% |
| Neutral | 18 | **95%** |
| Dov | 1 | 5% |

**On dov days (n=1):** Bull steepening **100%**.

**On neutral days (n=18):** Bear steepening **33%**, Bear flattening 33% (tied modal).

**On hawk days:** none in this phase.

**Steepener:** **+15 bp** — the regime your original thesis needed. Belly underperforms on hawk tails; on average both legs rise with Dec-27 leading.

---

## Phase IV — Bull flattening (18 May – 29 Jun)

**Net:** Dec-26 **−42 bp**, Dec-27 **−49 bp** → spread **−7 bp** → **bull flattening**.

| | n | Share |
|---|---:|---|
| Hawk | 0 | 0% |
| Neutral | 30 | **100%** |
| Dov | 0 | 0% |

**On neutral days (n=30):** Bull flattening **33%** (modal); Unchanged 23%.

Modal **daily** type: Bull flattening **33%** — no sessions breach the ±1.5σ tails, but **persistent** belly compression on the level.

**Steepener:** **−4 bp**. The **5 Jun** calendar steepener entry sat in this phase (belly already uninverted on 1M; 3M spread near flat). Modal path = dovish **bull flattening**, not migration.

---

## What this means for the trade

1. **Four regimes, four overall types** — bear flat → bull steep → bear steep → bull flat. No single calendar spread wins all four without timing the switches.

2. **The steepener only carries Phases II–III** (+30 bp combined); Phase I (**−43 bp**) dominates the crisis window.

3. **Hawk/dov via μ ± 1.5σ** (σ ≈ 10 bp) flags only **tail** Dec-26 moves; Phases II–IV are almost entirely neutral on this filter, yet Phases III–IV still have clear **overall** curve types — so cumulative phase classification matters more than tail-day counts for P&L.

4. **Original thesis anatomy** (front-loaded hikes) was a Phase I–III story; **post-entry P&L** was a Phase IV story.
